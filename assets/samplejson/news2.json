	"content":"BCB also extended the contract of Under-19 strength and conditioning coach Richard Stonier until 2022. We had taken the decision earlier that we will continue to work with those who were involved with our Under-19 World Cup squad considering they have done a great job, BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury said. They did a great job. They brought a trophy like World Cup for Bangladesh Cricket. We had a plan to keep everyone and as part of that plan, we have extended the contract. Nawaz, a Cricket Australia high performance (level three) coach, is a former international cricketer for Sri Lanka and was an accomplished first-class batsman during his playing career. The 46-year-old has been involved in different coaching capacities since his retirement in 2004. He worked with the Sri Lanka Under-19 side from 2009 to 2014 as a batting coach and then was part of the Emerging Players Squad in 2014-15 before joining BCB."
