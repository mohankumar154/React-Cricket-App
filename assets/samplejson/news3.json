	"content":"Pakistan Test skipper Azhar Ali has said that managing over rates will be an issue following the implementation of the new rules ahead of cricket's return. With the saliva ban hogging the limelight, Azhar pointed out that his team had another challenge with maintaining the pace of the game, which he hopes can be overcome soon.Bowlers will now have to leave their sweaters and caps outside the boundary rope every time now when they come on to bowl instead of handing them over to the umpire as a means to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Pakistan experienced this challenge first-hand during their inter-squad scenario-based practice match on July 5 and 6 in Worcester.There are some areas where we have to adapt,Azhar said.In this weather, it was only the fast bowlers who sweated so it was a challenge for us to shine the ball. But, that's something which will change as the weather continues to get warm."
